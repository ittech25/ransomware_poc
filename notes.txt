steps:
1. attacker generates a key pair and puts public key in the malware
2. malware generate a random symmetric key and encrypts the victims data with it
3. it uses the public key in the malware to encrypt the symmetric key
4. program now has asymmetric ciphertext (key) and symmetric ciphertext (victim's data)
5. zeroizes symmetic key and original plaintext data to prevent recovery
6. malware shows the asymmetric ciphertext and how to pay ransom to the user
7. victim sends asymmetric ciphertext and money to the attacker
8. profit!
optional:
9. attacker can decrypt the asymmetic ciphertext with attacker's private key and sends the symmetric key to the victim.
10. victim can use the symmetric key to decrypt the data
